REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id_here
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
```

3. Add these variables:
   - `REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID` = your_service_id

## Step 6: Test the Form

1. Visit your website's contact page
2. Fill out the form with test data
3. Click "Send Message"
4. Check chatterifyservice@gmail.com for the email

## Important: Template Variables Setup

Make sure your EmailJS template includes ALL these variables in the content/body section:
- `{{from_name}}` - Sender's name
- `{{from_email}}` - Sender's email
- `{{phone}}` - Phone number
- `{{company}}` - Company name
- `{{service}}` - Service interested in
- `{{budget}}` - Budget range
- `{{message}}` - Message content

**Note:** Do NOT use `{{from_name}}` or `{{from_email}}` in the "From Name" or "From Email" fields. Use fixed values or leave default.

## Troubleshooting

- **400 Error:** This usually means template variables mismatch. Ensure:
  - All variables listed above exist in your template content
  - "From Name" field is NOT set to `{{from_name}}`
  - "Reply To" field is set to `{{from_email}}` (not "From Email")
  - Template ID, Service ID, and Public Key are correct
- **Email not received:** Check spam folder
- **Error sending:** Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- **Gmail blocking:** Make sure you've authorized EmailJS in Gmail security settings
- **Rate limits:** Free EmailJS plan allows 200 emails/month

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` files to Git
- The Public Key is safe to expose in frontend code
- Keep Service ID and Template ID in environment variables for extra security
